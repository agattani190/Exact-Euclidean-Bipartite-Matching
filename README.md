# Exact-Euclidean-Bipartite-Matching

This repository contains two algorithms to calculate the exact minimum cost euclidean bipartite matching between two sets of points.

In the Runner.java file, specify the paths to the two point sets and the number of points to be used from each set.
 
Simply run the Runner.java file to get a comparison of the time taken by the two algorithms to get the minimum cost matching.
